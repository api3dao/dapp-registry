## Listing your project

To list your project in the API3 dapp registry, follow these steps:

- Fork this repository
- Add a new json with the same name as your project to `/projects`. You can use this [template](./projects/sample-datafeed.json) as a starting point
- Run `yarn build` to build the project. This will also validate the json file
- Create a pull request with your changes

## API

The following variables/functions are exported from this package

### PROJECTS

A static array of `Project` objects that contain all the information about each project in `/projects`.

### Types

Types are also exported and can be found in `src/types.ts`.
Types are generated from [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas.
These schemas are also used to validate each project.

## Development

This project works by combining the various JSON files defined in the `/projects` directory into a single generated TypeScript file.
This file is then validated to ensure that each project description conforms to specific requirements.
The TypeScript file is generated by running any of these commands

```sh
yarn generate:projects

# Alternatively, watch the /projects directory and regenerate on file change
yarn dev
```

### Validation

Validations can be run with the following commands.

```sh
# Validate each project JSON file conforms to the zod schemas
yarn validate:projects

# Run all validations synchronously
yarn validate
```
