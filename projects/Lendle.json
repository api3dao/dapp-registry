  "description": "At Lendle, we firmly believe that lending and borrowing protocols are the backbone of a well-functioning DeFi ecosystem. These protocols empower users to make the most of their cryptocurrencies, allowing them to engage in complex financial strategies and acting as a catalyst that promotes further participation within DeFi./nIn line with this vision, we are committed to bringing a new wave of innovation to the lending and borrowing landscape. Our goal is to develop a new generation of DeFi features, building on the foundation laid by giants like Aave and Geist./nWe believe that by providing users with a wider range of options for lending and borrowing, we can help to further incentivize the growth of DeFi, building a more resilient and sustainable financial system that benefits everyone.",
