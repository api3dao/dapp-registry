  "description": "ChainLocker seeks to optimize intermediary-free conditional digital asset escrow. Users customize and deploy their own “ChainLockers”: non-custodial escrow smart contracts with immutable parameters, including the option to make execution contingent on external data. Each ChainLocker is a unique address, ensuring funds of different counterparties are not commingled and that execution is dictated strictly via code./n/nChainLockers can lock native gas tokens or ERC20-compliant tokens, with other immutable feature options including refundability, expiration, identified counterparty or open offer, and oracle-fed data contingency. Users may also print a US dollar-denominated Receipt for certain locked assets. ",
