The platform aims to democratize access to liquidity, catering not only to DeFi users but also to protocols through 'Liquidity Hooks.'/n/nOne of the biggest challenges for DeFi protocols nowadays is to bootstrap initial liquidity and consistently source it in order to grow. /n/nMany protocols struggle to access liquidity in money markets due to its lack of composability, thereby capping protocol growth. While the DeFi landscape evolves continuously to accommodate diverse borrowing use cases, the architecture of money markets has not correspondingly evolved. This prompts protocols to independently source liquidity themselves, though liquidity is limited. Consequently, protocols spend a significant amount of their native token supply on incentives to source liquidity.

Lenders supply supported Blast assets for a predetermined lending period in return for Orbit Assets (oAssets), which represent the lender's initial principal as well as accrued yield. /n/nUpon expiry of the predetermined lending period, oAssets can be redeemed for principal + accrued yield - this simplifies yield collection to be done just by holding on to them. Users can also borrow assets by providing supported Blast assets as collateral and borrowing at under the protocol-defined loan-to-value ratio. /n/nNative yield from lender assets and provided collaterals first accumulate to the Orbit token, acting as the medium to forward future Blast yield value to the present.
